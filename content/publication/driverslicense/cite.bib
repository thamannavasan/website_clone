	abstract = {This report measures the economic impact of opening access to driver’s licenses for all immigrant drivers in Colorado. Although under Colorado law undocumented drivers are eligible for licenses, many still cannot obtain them because of the lack of funding dedicated to the license issuance program. The report concludes that “the economic and social benefits of providing driver’s licenses to all immigrants far outweigh the administrative costs of the program.” (Colorado Fiscal Institute)},
