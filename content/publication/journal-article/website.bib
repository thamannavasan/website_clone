	abstract = {To explore the distinction between state dependence and heterogeneity in repeated decisions, this paper combines a Mixed Logit model with a state dependence parameterization from the marketing literature to study fishing location choices of commercial sea urchin divers in California. It examines implications of ignoring either effect and finds in all cases that true state dependence is an important determinant of location choice. Consequently, spatial policies like marine reserves can lead to differences in the short- and long-run behavioral responses of the fishing fleet. Under some specifications, random preference parameters are statistically significant when state dependence is excluded from the model, but when it is included, random preference parameters are not significant. In other specifications, including state dependence only dampens the variability in preference parameters. These results highlight the importance of gathering and analyzing diary-type data for commercial fisheries as well as for similar choice problems in recreation demand.},

	abstract = {An outbreak of chronic wasting disease ({CWD}) in farmed elk in Saskatchewan from 1996 to 2002 was reviewed to 1, determine the progression of {CWD} from infection to death in farmed elk; 2, assess animal risk factors for {CWD} infection in farmed elk; 3, assess farm management and exposure risk factors for within herd {CWD} transmission; and 4, assess the suitability of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency’s ({CFIA}) current disease control policy for {CWD} in light of the findings. The results from animal movement tracing, animal testing, and a farm management questionnaire were used. The duration of {CWD} (time from exposure to death of a {CWD} test-positive animal) was between a mean minimum of 19 months and a mean maximum of 40 months. Age and sex were not associated with {CWD} infection, except that adult elk (≥ 2 y) were more likely to be infected than young elk ({\textless} 18 mo) ({RR} = 2.3, 95\% {CI} 1.6–3.5). Elk calves born in the last 18 mo prior to the death or diagnosis of their dam were at higher risk if their dams died of {CWD} ({RR} = 4.1, 95\% {CI} 1.5–11.4) or exhibited clinical signs of {CWD} ({RR} = 8.3, 95\% {CI} 2.7–25.7). Significant risk factors for transmission of {CWD} on elk farms were the introduction from an infected farm of trace-in elk that died of {CWD} ({RR} = 13.5, 95\% {CI} 2.0–91) or developed clinical signs of {CWD} ({RR} = 7.1, 95\% {CI} 0.93–54) and the elapsed time in years since the incursion of {CWD} ({OR} = 5.6, 95\% {CI} 1.8–17.4). The assumptions on which {CFIA}’s disease control policies were based were validated, but based on this new information, quarantine in cases where exposure to preclinical elk has occurred could be considered as an alternative to whole herd eradication.},

Shellﬁsh are important economically, ecologically, and socially to the Puget Sound basin. The State of Washington manages the safety of shellﬁsh harvest areas by assessing water quality on an ongoing basis and instituting advisories and closures based on water quality thresholds. Managers currently have little information to understand the effect of these closures on harvesting effort or economic values. In order to address this important need, we recently conducted a contingent behavior survey of recreational shellﬁsh harvesters that use Puget Sound beaches. The survey elicited the number of annual trips respondents would expect to take under alternative closure scenarios, including a baseline of no closure. We estimate the demand for recreational trips using a count model system, quantifying the economic value lost to harvesters when beaches are closed due to pollution or biotoxins.},

	abstract = {Many biological and economic processes in fisheries occur seasonally though most of the extant literature tends to neglect periodicity. This work is an attempt to treat seasonality in a systematic way. We present a multi-season multi-state bioeconomic model and apply a periodic Bellman approach using dynamic programming to obtain the optimal feedback policy of each season. Our approach has rich potentials. It could deal with seasonal patterns of arbitrary uneven lengths: some may span years and some may occur within a year. Our numerical illustration demonstrates that a seasonal dynamic optimization model allows for naturally occurring seasonal moratorium or potentially a Marine Protected Area ({MPA}). It shows that there exists optimal dynamic paths that develop into a permanent equilibrium cycle, which consists of one harvesting season followed by a moratorium period. This indicates an optimal closure of the fishery that a yearly model would overlook. Fishing pressure on the mature stock elicits even heavier harvesting in the next season on the same group. A protective moratorium of the immature hinders the value of the whole stock.},

Consequently, understanding the dynamics of this emerging infectious disease, and particularly the dynamics of its transmission, has emerged as an important challenge for contemporary ecologists and wildlife managers. Although {CWD} is contagious among deer, the relative importance of pathways for its transmission remains unclear. We developed seven competing models, and then used data from two {CWD} outbreaks in captive mule deer and model selection to compare them. We found that models portraying indirect transmission through the environment had 3.8 times more support in the data than models representing transmission by direct contact between infected and susceptible deer. Model-averaged estimates of the basic reproductive number (R₀) were 1.3 or greater, indicating likely local persistence of {CWD} in natural populations under conditions resembling those we studied. Our findings demonstrate the apparent importance of indirect, environmental transmission in {CWD} and the challenges this presents for controlling the disease.]},

	abstract = {We develop a model of {CWD} management by nonselective deer harvest, currently the most feasible approach available for managing {CWD} in wild populations. We use the model to explore the effects of 6 common harvest strategies on disease prevalence and to identify potential optimal harvest policies for reducing disease prevalence without population collapse. The model includes 4 deer categories (juveniles, adult females, younger adult males, older adult males) that may be harvested at different rates, a food-based carrying capacity, which influences juvenile survival but not adult reproduction or survival, and seasonal force of infection terms for each deer category under differing frequency-dependent transmission dynamics resulting from environmental and direct contact mechanisms. Numerical experiments show that the interval of transmission coefficients β where the disease can be controlled is generally narrow and efficiency of a harvest policy to reduce disease prevalence depends crucially on the details of the disease transmission mechanism, in particular on the intensity of disease transmission to juveniles and the potential differences in the behavior of older and younger males that influence contact rates. Optimal harvest policy to minimize disease prevalence for each of the assumed transmission mechanisms is shown to depend on harvest intensity. Across mechanisms, a harvest that focuses on antlered deer, without distinguishing between age classes reduces disease prevalence most consistently, whereas distinguishing between young and older antlered deer produces higher uncertainty in the harvest effects on disease prevalence. Our results show that, despite uncertainties, a modelling approach can determine classes of harvest strategy that are most likely to be effective in combatting {CWD}.},

However, the value gained from expected improvements in forecast skill in terms of achieving management goals is rarely quantified as part of research objectives. Using Monte Carlo simulations of population dynamics, we assessed the effect of forecast skill under two strategies for managing Oregon coast natural ({OCN}) coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). The first, or status quo, strategy is currently being used to rebuild threatened {OCN} coho populations. This strategy determines harvest based on both a forecasted marine survival rate and parental spawner abundance. The second strategy relies on a forecast of preharvest adult abundance to achieve a constant spawner escapement target. Performance of the status quo strategy was largely insensitive to forecast skill, while the second strategy showed sensitivity that varied with escapement target and specific performance metric. The results imply that effort towards improving forecasts is not justifiable solely on the basis of improved management under the status quo strategy, though it may be were the management strategy altered.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}. . In recent years our understanding of the intricate connections between climate variability, marine and freshwater environmental conditions and the responses of fish stocks has improved considerably. With predictable relationships between the environment and stock abundance, fishery managers should be able to forecast variation in stock survival and recruitment. Such forecasts present an opportunity for increasing the economic value of fisheries and for achieving other management objectives, such as stock conservation and maintenance of population diversity. After describing a 4-step framework for addressing the question ‘What is a forecast worth?’ in a fishery decision-making context, we introduce the management system for Washington's coastal coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) fishery. Then we apply the 4-step framework to estimate the value of improved run size forecasts in the annual harvest management of coho salmon in Washington State. Our principal analytical tool is a stochastic simulation model that incorporates the main characteristics of the fishery. The paper concludes with a discussion of opportunities and constraints to the use of climate-based forecasts in fishery management on various spatial and temporal scales, and we consider the challenges associated with forecasting variations in fish stock size caused by shifts in climate and related ocean conditions.},

Our model incorporates planting density and the level and timing of fuel reduction treatment as landowner decisions. These factors affect, among other things, the loss a landowner incurs should fire arrive before harvesting. The value of information depends on the nature and combination of mistakes a landowner makes, the relationship between fire arrival and stand age, and on whether the landowner undertakes fuel treatment and values nontimber benefits. Information of various types is of most value to a landowner who does not undertake fuel treatment. The value of information about the magnitude of fire risk is also more than twice as high when the landowner underestimates fire risk, rather than overestimating it. For a landowner who undertakes fuel treatment but makes multiple mistakes, the asymmetry between overestimating and underestimating fire risk and efficacy of fuel reduction is even more pronounced.},

In the face of an uncertain population size, a resource manager's species-control efforts provide two potential benefits: (1) a direct benefit of possibly reducing the population of invasive species, and (2) an indirect benefit of information acquisition (due to learning about the population size, which reduces uncertainty). We provide a methodology that takes into account both of these benefits, and show how optimal management decisions are altered in the presence of the indirect benefit of learning. We then apply this methodology to the case of controlling the Brown Treesnake (Boiga irregularis) on the island of Saipan. We find that the indirect benefit--the value of information to reduce uncertainty--is likely to be quite large.},

	abstract = {A formulation for the value of information for conflict resolution is shown to provide insights and guidance for identifying the attributes of scientific procedures and studies needed to support participatoryrisk assessment and decision making. Traditional approaches to the value of information are first reviewed, including the determination of potential reductions in the uncertainty variance of risk-model outputs resulting from a proposed study or data collection program, and the economic value of information in a decision-analytic context. Limitations of these metrics are identified — when scientific assessments are conducted by multiple experts who may be exposed to either consistent or inconsistent observations, and when decision value is required for multiple stakeholders who may differ in their prior beliefs, methods for interpreting scientific studies, and their economic valuations for the outcomes of alternative decisions. Methods for identifying the sources and implications of differences in these among experts and stakeholders are presented. The use of a precautionary ratio is proposed as a means for characterizing the source of differing degrees of precaution exhibited towards a proposed project by different rational stakeholders, highlighting the programmatic and scientific changes that could be considered by project proponents to attempt to build a consensus with other, more-precautionary parties. Initial methods for computing a monetary value of information for conflict resolution are also presented.},

	abstract = {The presence of invasive species is often not realized until well after the species becomes established. Discovering the location and extent of infestation before the invasive species causes widespread damage typically requires intensive monitoring efforts. In this paper, we analyze the problem of controlling an invasive species when there is imperfect information about the degree of infestation. We model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process in which the decision-maker receives an imperfect signal about the level of infestation. The decision-maker then chooses a management action to minimize expected costs based on beliefs about the level of infestation. We apply this model to a simple application with three possible levels of infestation where the decision-maker can choose to take no action, only monitor, only treat, or do both monitoring and treatment jointly. We solve for optimal management as a function of beliefs about the level of infestation. For a case with positive monitoring and treatment costs, we ﬁnd that the optimal policy involves choosing no action when there is a sufﬁciently large probability of no infestation, monitoring alone with intermediate probability values and treatment alone when the probability of moderate or high infestation is large. We also show how optimal management and expected costs change as the cost or quality of information from monitoring changes. With costless and perfect monitoring, expected costs are 20–30\% lower across the range of belief states relative to the expected costs without monitoring.},

However, models of renewable resource management under uncertainty have commonly assumed economic and biological uncertainties to be uncorrelated. We present examples of valuable fish species that experience correlated variation in biological growth and catchability, in response to a common environmental disturbance. Building correlation into a model of renewable resource management under uncertainty, we find correlation to alter the optimal response by managers to cost disturbances, and impact the value of retaining intra-period flexibility over harvest targets. Examining the performance of three harvest control mechanisms—harvest quotas, effort quotas, and taxes—reveals that positive correlation between costs and growth favors harvest quotas over effort quotas, and effort quotas over taxes (and vice versa). The model is then applied numerically to the Pacific bigeye tuna fishery, which experiences positively correlated shocks driven by the El Niño Southern Oscillation. Correlation qualitatively changes the optimal response to a cost shock, and harvest quotas are found to be strongly favored over both effort quotas and taxes.},

Among other results we find: (1) when uncertainties are high, we generally reject the constant-escapement rule advocated in much of the existing literature, (2) inaccurate stock estimation affects policy in a fundamentally different way than the other sources of uncertainty, and (3) the optimal policy leads to significantly higher commercial profits and lower extinction risk than the optimal constant-escapement policy (by 42\% and 56\%, respectively).},

First, while it might seem that a prediction of adverse future conditions should lead to more conservative management, the opposite may be true. Second, optimal management requires only a one-period-ahead forecast, suggesting forecast accuracy is more important than forecast lead time. Finally, we derive conditions on environmental fluctuations guaranteeing positive optimal harvest in every period.

Les variations dans les conditions de l'environnement affectent la croissance de la ressource renouvelable. La capacitéà prévoir ces variations s'améliore et ouvre la possibilité d'améliorer la gestion de la ressource. Les auteurs utilisent un modèle de ressource renouvelable avec croissance stochastique et obtiennent trois résultats. D'abord, alors qu'il peut sembler que des prévisions pessimistes de conditions difficiles dans l'avenir peuvent conduire à une gestion plus conservatrice, le contraire peut être vrai. Ensuite, la gestion optimale requiert seulement une prédiction pour la prochaine période: voilà qui suggère qu'il est plus important d'avoir une prévision exacte que d'avoir des prévisions à plus long terme.

Le modèle utilise 21 paramètres pour décrire la performance de deux classes de bateaux exploitant plusieurs stocks de crevettes. Il prédit le nombre de bateaux de chaque classe entrant dans la pêcherie sous un régime d'accès libre, prédiction que nous comparons aux données disponibles. Avec ce modèle, nous estimons le nombre optimal, au point de vue économique, de bateaux de chaque type.},

The optimal escapement in this model is compared with that in the corresponding deterministic model and it is shown how the way in which unit harvesting costs vary with population abundance can be important in determining the relative sizes of the optimal escapements. In most cases, the optimal stochastic escapement is no less than the optimal deterministic escapement.},

Evidence of climatic regulation of domoic acid in shellfish over the past 20 y in the Northern California Current regime is shown. The timing of elevated domoic acid is strongly related to warm phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Oceanic Niño Index, an indicator of El Niño events. Ocean conditions in the northeast Pacific that are associated with warm phases of these indices, including changes in prevailing currents and advection of anomalously warm water masses onto the continental shelf, are hypothesized to contribute to increases in this toxin. We present an applied domoic acid risk assessment model for the {US} West Coast based on combined climatic and local variables. Evidence of regional- to basin-scale controls on domoic acid has not previously been presented. Our findings have implications in coastal zones worldwide that are affected by this toxin and are particularly relevant given the increased frequency of anomalously warm ocean conditions.},

Three data sources were used to provide information on the nature of the injuries sustained, as well as their circumstances. High rates of fatal and non-fatal injury were found, with most deaths attributed to drowning, and concerning a vessel operating in rough seas or poor weather. A higher fatal injury rate was found for the west coast of New Zealand when compared with the rest of the country. This is likely to be due to a combination of factors, including rougher sea conditions, a lower density of fishing vessels operating in the area, and the siting of many west coast fishing ports at dangerous river and harbour bars. Injuries to hands and fingers related to the use of winches, machinery and knives were common, as were back strains associated with lifting, and a variety ofinjuries resulting from falls. There is need for a comprehensive injury information source, such as an industry based register specific for fishing, so that effective preventative strategies and their evaluation can be developed.},

Methods—Comprehensive surveillance of deaths in commercial ﬁshing was established by our {oYce} during 1991 and 1992 for Alaska. Demographic data and data on risk factors and incidents were compiled and analysed for trend.
Results—During 1991–8, there was a signiﬁcant (p{\textless}0.001) decrease in deaths in Alaska related to commercial ﬁshing. Although drownings from ﬁshermen falling overboard and events related to crab ﬁshing vessels (often conducted far {oVshore} and in winter) have continued to occur, marked progress (signiﬁcant downward trend, p{\textless}0.001) has been made in saving the lives of people involved in vessels capsising and sinking.
Conclusions—Speciﬁc measures tailored to prevent drowning associated with vessels capsising and sinking in Alaska’s commercial ﬁshing industry have been successful. However, these events continue to occur, and place ﬁshermen and rescue personnel at substantial risk. Additional strategies must be identiﬁed to reduce the frequency of vessels capsising and sinking, to enable parallel improvements in the mortality among crab ﬁshermen, and to prevent ﬁshermen falling overboard and drownings associated with them.},

	abstract = {Visitor spending in the recreational razor clam ﬁshery positively impacts the coastal economies of Grays Harbor and Paciﬁc counties in Washington State. Since 1991 the ﬁshery has frequently closed due to harmful algal blooms ({HABs}). These events reduce or eliminate recreational clam-related visitor spending. We develop an economic impact model, based on recreationists’ spending, to estimate the economic impacts of these closures. To estimate visitor expenditure patterns, questionnaires were distributed in April of 2008 to an on-site sample of clammers at four beaches on Washington’s Paciﬁc coast: Mocrocks, Copalis, Twin Harbors, and Long Beach. Based upon responses from 240 parties, the average expenditure per party ranged from \$268.77 at Mocrocks beach to \$412.67 at Long Beach. Overall expenditures for the 2007–2008 season were estimated at \$24.4 million. A regional input–output model was used to estimate that the ﬁshery had the local economic impact of supporting 404 full-time equivalent jobs and \$12.6 million in labor income. To estimate negative impacts of {HAB} closures, expected visitor expenditures are adjusted to account for visitors’ stated intentions when razor clamming is unavailable. For a full year closure of all four beaches, the estimated negative economic impact is a loss of support from the razor clam ﬁshery impacting 339 full-time equivalent jobs and \$10.6 million of labor income in the two counties. Further, impacts were calculated for beach closures ranging from a single (2–5 days) season opening to a full year, for individual beaches and combinations of beaches. As expected, the closing of a single opening at one beach had the smallest economic impacts, while whole season closures at multiple beaches had the largest impact.},
